This is an Express JS application meant for use with the Dancing Goat sample project within Kentico Cloud. You can read more about the our JavaScript SDKs here: [https://github.com/Enngage/kentico-cloud-js](https://github.com/Enngage/kentico-cloud-js)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the **delivery.js** file and set the projectID variable to your sample project's Project ID:
```
const projectId = '<your-project-id-here>';

The application will then be available at localhost:3000 (configurable in /bin/www).
